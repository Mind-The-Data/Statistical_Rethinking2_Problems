# Statistical_Rethinking2_Problems
Currently working through Richard McElreath's Statistical Rethinking2 (new edition)
and here you will find my solutions to his back of the chapter problems as well as 
pymc3 developers code translation of code snippets throughout the book.
I choose to extend the .ipynb translations to include the code translations for quick 
reference in a single file. I have been adding explainations where I thought appropriate. 

Obviously, if you are trying to learn, best work the problems yourself, and only
if you're stuck would you want to use this repository for an idea
